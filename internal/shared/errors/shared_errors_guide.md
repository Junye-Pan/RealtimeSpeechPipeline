# Shared Errors Guide

Status:
- scaffold only (not implemented yet)

Planned scope:
- normalized internal error classes and mapping helpers reused across internal domains
- shared classification helpers for cross-domain reporting/gating surfaces

Boundary:
- keep domain-specific error semantics and policy actions in their owning modules.
