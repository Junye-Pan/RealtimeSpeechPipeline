# Shared Types Guide

Status:
- scaffold only (not implemented yet)

Planned scope:
- internal type aliases and small envelopes shared across multiple internal domains
- minimal reusable helper types that reduce duplication without owning contract semantics

Boundary:
- external API contracts remain owned under `api/`; this folder is internal-only shared typing support.
