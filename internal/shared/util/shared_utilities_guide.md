# Shared Utilities Guide

Status:
- scaffold only (not implemented yet)

Planned scope:
- generic deterministic utility helpers that are reusable across internal domains
- helper functions that do not carry business semantics or policy ownership

Boundary:
- do not move domain contracts, scheduling, policy, or observability semantics into shared utilities.
